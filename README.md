Cook for Machine Learning is a helper package to easily create dataset for machine learning (deep learning).

It is an initial version, so only a few components were implemented now. We are welcome any contribution makes this library better. Cook for Machine Learning has a plan to provide various storage (hdf5, lmdb, ...) and data (image, text, class, ...) types.
